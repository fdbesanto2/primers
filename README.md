(Forked form https://github.com/rstudio-education/primers)

[Garrett Grolemund](https://github.com/garrettgman) developed the contents of this repository. [Mauro Lepore](https://github.com/maurolepore) adapted the contents to more strongly engage partners of the [ForestGEO](http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/) network.

[RStudio Cloud](http://rstudio.cloud) is a free, cloud based version of the RStudio IDE.

Packaged within RStudio Cloud are __primers__, which are collections of interactive tutorials made with [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/). These primers teach the basics of R and the Tidyverse. This repository contains the contents of those primers.
